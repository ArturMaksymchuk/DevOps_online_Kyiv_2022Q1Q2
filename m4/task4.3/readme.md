# TASK 4.1

## Part 1


1. How many states could has a process in Linux?

#### There are five Linux process states: 
#### - created
#### - ready
#### - running
#### - waiting
#### - terminated

2. Examine the pstree command. Make output (highlight) the chain (ancestors) of the current process.

3. What is a proc file system?



4. Print information about the processor (its type, supported technologies, etc.).

5. Use the ps command to get information about the process. The information should be as follows: the owner of the process, the arguments with which the process was launched for execution, the group owner of this process, etc.

6. How to define kernel processes and user processes?

#### Kernel processes with square brackets. Normal processes is without square brackets.

7. Print the list of processes to the terminal. Briefly describe the statuses of the processes. What condition are they in, or can they be arriving in?

8. Display only the processes of a specific user.

9. What utilities can be used to analyze existing running tasks (by analyzing the help for the ps command)?

#### top

10. What information does top command display?

#### The top command can display system summary information. There are  PID, users , CPU and memory usage ,priority and other information.

11. Display the processes of the specific user using the top command.

12. What interactive commands can be used to control the top command? Give a couple of examples.

#### Sort by %MEM - M

#### Sort by %CPU - P 
![](https://github.com/ArturMaksymchuk/materialsEpam/blob/master/m4/task3/12.2.png)

#### Change display units - E - in top values; e - in process list

#### - Change Text Color - Z

#### - Limit Process Number - n [value]. For example - n 5

13. Sort the contents of the processes window using various parameters (for example, the amount of processor time taken up, etc.)
#### Sort by %MEM - M, sort by %CPU - P(see p.12)
#### Sort by TIME+ - T 
![](https://github.com/ArturMaksymchuk/materialsEpam/blob/master/m4/task3/13.1.png)

#### Sort by PID - N 
![](https://github.com/ArturMaksymchuk/materialsEpam/blob/master/m4/task3/13.2.png)

14. Concept of priority, what commands are used to set priority?

#### Priority means what task runing early.
#### To change prioryty use comand renaice and nice to start program with special priority.

![](https://github.com/ArturMaksymchuk/materialsEpam/blob/master/m4/task3/14.4.png)

15. Can I change the priority of a process using the top command? If so, how?

#### Change priority: r > [proces value] > [value to change]

16. Examine the kill command. How to send with the kill command process control signal? Give an example of commonly used signals.

17. Commands jobs, fg, bg, nohup. What are they for? Use the sleep, yes command to demonstrate the process control mechanism with fg, bg.

## Part 2

1. Check the implementability of the most frequently used OPENSSH commands in the MS
Windows operating system. (Description of the expected result of the commands +screenshots:
command â€“ result should be presented)


2. Implement basic SSH settings to increase the security of the client-server connection (at least)



3. List the options for choosing keys for encryption in SSH. Implement 3 of them.



4. Implement port forwarding for the SSH client from the host machine to the guest Linux virtual machine behind NAT.



5*. Intercept (capture) traffic (tcpdump, wireshark) while authorizing the remote client on the server using ssh, telnet, rlogin. Analyze the result.
